#Notes on open access (OA) assessment

## Methodology:
- Assessment was done in two batches: first 500 articles in one day and the remaining on another day; typically breaks after every 100 articles
- Review and clean-up on a different day (day3) where I checked for duplicated DOIs and improved consistency of highlighting potential issues
- Have additionally included OA badge colour

## Possible issues:
- Several duplicated entries discovered
- Several conference abstracts found; sometimes full paper is in the list, sometimes not
- Occassionally found inconsistency in OA bade colour between PubMed and publisher page
- Sometimes Unpaywall did not work on the publisher page
- Rarely article was available via publisher page but not Unpaywall
- Couple of situations where DOI is missing 
- Sometimes erratums have made their way into the list
- At least one preprint is in the list
- At least one book chapter is in the list
- At least one thesis is in the list
- Couple of times full text was available on ResearchGate but not via Unpaywall; still reporting Unpaywall result but highlighted

## Limitations:
- Possibility of an error in reporting of badge colour in the following situations:
	- Situations when the publisher webpage had background colour making it harder to distinguish bronze vs. gold
	- Green vs. gold both start with "G"; so accidents can happen
	- Differences between PubMed page and publisher page
- Fatigue

## Possible follow-ups:
- Unpaywall provides an API access; could be possible to re-compile this via API query
