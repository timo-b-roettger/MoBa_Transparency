### How to use the task management boards:

The project is managed in its own task management board. To manage projects in the task management boards, click on Projects and chose "MoBa transparency assessment". You will see three columns, organized according to [Kanban principles](https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources): "todo", "in progress" and "done". Here we keep track of tasks, questions, discussion points, etc. alongside their status. You can create a card by "add item" on the bottom of the column. You can quickly draft an item title there which adds the element to the respective column as a draft. Eventually, these items should be stored as so-called "GitHub issues", so you want to click on the item and then click on "Convert to issue" on the right hand side. When converted to an "issue", you can assign members and add a label to it. Assigning a member helps us keep track of who does what. Labels are an easy way to categorize issues according to what action is needed. For now I have defined three labels, but that might change as we evolve together. 
- help wanted: looking for someone to take over the task or help with completing it
- input: need input asynchronously
- meeting: to be discussed at next meeting
